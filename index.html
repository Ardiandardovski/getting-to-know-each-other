    <h1>Getting To Know Ardian Dardovski </h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Ardian I'm 5"11 and I was born in america. But me and my family are from Albania. Also I played the clarinet in Highschool and really enjoyed it. Now My mom and my dad are very caring people who truly want to see me do my best. My mom is a pre-K teacher and my dad is a manger at multiple parking faculties in Chicago.I am planning on majoring in Computer Sceince.</p>
    <h2>What I hope to learn in this course</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Since I haven't had any computer sceince experince I hope to be able to understand all the basic techniques</li>
    <li>I hope to learn as many coding languages as I can.</li>
    <li>Also I hope to be able to understand all the conversions and how some certain letters equal numbers</li>
    <li>How to make websites with ease with everything HTML,CSS,Java any hopefully others</li>
    <li>Obviously I hope to keep up with the class and be able to do anything assigned to me with ease.</li>
    <li>Finally would hope to learn on to be able to get interships and when can you get them espically for computer science major wise.</li>
   </ul>
    <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>My favorite Hobby I would say is watching and playing sports. I used to play football and track and even a little bit of baseball throughtout my Highschool career. I really enjoyed them and made numerous friends and it made me grow as a person. Which is why I'm looking to join a sports club. It could be any sport. Finally I love watching football every sunday with my family and just non-stop football for like 8 hours.</p>
